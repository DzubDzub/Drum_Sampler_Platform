### Context
Strefa Perkusistów is a renown drumming academy, located in Olsztyn, Poland.
Their unique approach to students and teaching methods proved to be revolutionary 
and made countless students successful in the music industry both locally and internationally.
As one of the authors (Robert Jurczak) is a former employee of said company, he knows the teaching methods and
program used there. The company is in need of a groundbreaking tool that will revolutionize teaching process of young adepts 
of the drumming craft worldwide.


### Problem
The vast majority of students learning at Strefa Perkusistów are kids. An inherent part of learning any musical
instrument is learning musical notation, which is a tedious and uninteresting process for children.
This potentially discourages students from making progress in learning how to play the drum kit, as it's 
not interactive and it's simply something based on memorizing and practicing the notation. No such tool exists that
lets one practice the drum rythms with live playback, that is intuitive, interactive and doesn't use notes.

### Proposed Solution
The solution to the aforementioned problem could be developing an interactive drumming sampler that utilizes both
normal musical notation and a special picture system patented by the CEO and the lead teacher of this company - Chris Sydor.
Using web development techniques, the team shall develop a web application that allows students to create their own rythms,
playing them back with live playback, metronome and visual aid (highliting the currently played note) with or without real musical notation.
